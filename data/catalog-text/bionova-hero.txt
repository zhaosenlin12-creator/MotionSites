Create a "BIONOVA" biotech consulting hero section that spans exactly 100vh on desktop (scrollable on mobile). Use Poppins font (imported from Google Fonts) as the heading font family. Install hls.js for video streaming.

Design system:

Background: white (hsl(0 0% 100%))

Foreground/text: dark gray (hsl(0 0% 17%))

Hero button color: soft blue (hsl(213 90% 78%))

Font: Poppins (400, 500, 600, 700 weights)

Custom animation fade-up: translateY(20px) + opacity 0 + blur(4px) → translateY(0) + opacity 1 + blur(0), 700ms with cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1) easing, forwards fill

Navigation:

Logo text "BIONOVA" (bold, tracking-tight, xl) on the left

Center links (hidden on mobile): About, Offerings, Pricing, Blog — semibold, text-sm, 70% opacity, hover to full

Right side (hidden on mobile): "Log in" text link + "Request a call" rounded-full pill button in hero-btn blue with white text

Layout:

Full section: min-h-screen lg:h-screen, flex column, lg:overflow-hidden

Content area: px-5 lg:px-16, pb-8 lg:pb-[82px], flex-1

Two-column grid (lg:grid-cols-2), items-stretch, gap-8

Left column (flex col, justify-between, fade-up animation):

Top group:

H1 with text sizes: text-[2rem] sm:text-5xl lg:text-[3.5rem] xl:text-7xl, leading-[1.08], tracking-tight, font-normal

First line: small rounded-full image pill (w-20 h-10 / sm:w-24 sm:h-12, bg-cover) inline next to "World-class"

Second line: "consultants that"

Third line: "empower" followed by an inline pill button with Play icon + "How do we work" (border-2, rounded-full, smaller text on mobile)

Fourth line: "biotech leaders"

CTAs directly under headline (pt-6): "Contact us" blue pill button with ArrowUpRight icon + "Request a call" underlined text link

Bottom group (hidden on mobile, hidden lg:block):

Description paragraph (text-sm, max-w-md)

Logo bar: "Headway", "brightline", "hazel", "G&STC" — bold text-2xl, flex-wrap

Right column (flex col, gap-4, fade-up with 150ms delay):

Card 1 (top, larger): rounded-[1.5rem] lg:rounded-[2.5rem], bg-black, flex-1, min-h-[200px] on mobile

Background: autoplay muted looping HLS video — https://stream.mux.com/1RdbcBtpEUK6501pc6yaIvwo9UfSnOg02k1uHxat00xR3w.m3u8 — object-cover, full size

White heading (text-2xl lg:text-3xl): "If you're ready to build your bioventure, let's get in touch."

Bottom: description text (white/85) + white circle arrow button (bg-background)

Cards 2 & 3 (bottom row): grid-cols-2, gap-3 lg:gap-4, flex-1

Card 2: rounded-[1.5rem] lg:rounded-[2.5rem], bg-black, p-5 lg:p-8, min-h-[180px]

Background: HLS video https://stream.mux.com/t1TbTB8M1VYHkhxBuap4A8Vm1x015HTHyuQxqchDBago.m3u8 — scaled to 150%, centered with top-1/2 left-1/2 -translate-x/y-1/2

Top: "scientists" white pill badge

Bottom: large "34" number (text-4xl lg:text-7xl, white) + description (text-xs lg:text-sm, white/80)

HLS video implementation:

Use hls.js library with useRef for each video element

Loop through all 3 streams in a single useEffect

Handle native HLS (Safari) with canPlayType fallback

All videos: autoPlay, muted, loop, playsInline, preload="auto"

All card content uses relative z-10 to sit above the video

Responsive (mobile only):

Section becomes min-h-screen (scrollable) instead of fixed h-screen

Nav links and right-side buttons hidden below md

Smaller padding (px-5), smaller border radius (rounded-[1.5rem]), smaller card padding (p-5/p-6)

Bottom description/logo bar hidden below lg

Headline button smaller on mobile (px-4 py-1.5 text-sm)

Card text sizes scale down on mobile
