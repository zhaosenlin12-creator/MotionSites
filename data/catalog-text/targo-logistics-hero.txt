Design Prompt: Targo Hero Section

Brand Identity: Create a high-end, dark-themed hero section for a logistics brand called "targo". Use a color palette of deep black (#000000), a vibrant brand red (#EE3F2C), and crisp white for primary text. The typography should use the Rubik font family, with headlines in bold, uppercase, and slightly tight letter-spacing (approx. -4%).

Layout & Positioning:

Header: A clean top navigation bar with a white SVG logo (abstract symbol + "targo" wordmark) on the left. Include "Home", "About", and "Contact Us" links, plus a small red "Contact Us" button with clipped corners on the right.

Main Hero: The headline "Swift and Simple Transport" and a "Get Started" button should be left-aligned and positioned in the upper-third of the section (aligned toward the top rather than centered).

Bottom Widget: A "Book a Free Consultation" card positioned at the bottom-left.

Key Design Elements:

Video Background: An auto-looping, muted background video using URL: https://d8j0ntlcm91z4.cloudfront.net/user_38xzZboKViGWJOttwIXH07lWA1P/hf_20260227_042027_c4b2f2ea-1c7c-4d6e-9e3d-81a78063703f.mp4. Ensure it has 100% opacity with no dark overlay.

Clipped-Corner Buttons: All primary buttons must feature a custom geometric shape using CSS clip-path (a 10-12px diagonal cut on the top-right and bottom-left corners). Use the brand red for "Get Started" and solid white for "Book a Call".

Liquid Glass Effect: The consultation card must use advanced glassmorphism: backdrop-filter: blur(40px) saturate(180%), a 1px white border with 12% opacity, a subtle diagonal white-to-transparent shine gradient across the surface, and an inner box-shadow for depth.

Scaled Proportions: The layout should feel refined and compact. Headlines should be roughly 64px on desktop, and the overall spacing should avoid excessive padding to maintain a "scaled-down" professional look.

Technical Details:

Frameworks: React & Tailwind CSS.

Icons: Use the Phone icon from lucide-react inside the consultation button.

Responsiveness: Ensure the headline scales down to ~42px on mobile and the padding adjusts from 64px (desktop) to 32px (mobile).
