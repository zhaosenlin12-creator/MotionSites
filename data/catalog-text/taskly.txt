System Prompt: High-Fidelity "Liquid Glass" Hero Section

Core Layout: Create a 1600px max-width landing page hero section. The background should be pure white with a subtle, layered gradient glow in the top-left (using blurred ellipses in light blue #60B1FF and #319AFF). The design must be fully responsive, transitioning from a single-column mobile view to a dual-column desktop layout.

Typography:

Headlines & Brand: Use Fustat (Bold).
Body & UI: Use Inter (Normal/Medium).
Hero Headline: "Work smarter, achieve faster" (75px, 1.05 line-height, -2px tracking).

The "Strong Liquid Glass" Navbar:

Position: Sticky at top-[30px], centered, w-fit.
Visuals: backdrop-blur-[50px], background rgba(255,255,255,0.3), rounded-[16px].
Fidelity Details:
Outer Stroke: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1).
Inner Highlight Shadow: inset 0px 4px 4px 0px rgba(255,255,255,0.25).
Items: Logo "Taskly" (Fustat), Nav links (Home, Features, Company, Pricing), and a glassy "SignUp" button with an arrow icon.

The Glassy Orb (Hero Right):

Source URL: https://future.co/images/homepage/glassy-orb/orb-purple.webm
Blending Mode: Must use mix-blend-screen to filter the black background.
Scaling: scale-125 to make it massive and bleed slightly off-center.
Exact Color Grade (CSS Filter): hue-rotate(-55deg) saturate(250%) brightness(1.2) contrast(1.1). This transforms the purple asset into a vibrant, high-end "Electric Brand Blue" that matches the primary CTA.

Social Proof: A "Rated 4.9/5 by 2700+ customers" badge with five orange #FF801E stars.
Subheadline: "Effortlessly manage your projects, collaborate with your team, and achieve your goals with our intuitive task management tool." (18px, Inter, -1px tracking).

Color: rgba(0,132,255,0.8) with backdrop-blur-[2px].
Details: rounded-[16px], white text, inner highlight shadow inset 0px 4px 4px 0px rgba(255,255,255,0.35), and a white circular arrow icon.
Animation: Scale 1.02 on hover with a smooth transition.

Footer Logos: Include a "Trusted by Top-tier product companies" section at the bottom with 5 grayscale SVG logos (e.g., placeholder logos for tech companies) spaced at gap-[100px].

Key Technical Specs for the Developer:
