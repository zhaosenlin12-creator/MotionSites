- Background color: `#8a9aaa`
- Box shadow to simulate a real phone bezel: `inset 0 0 0 2px rgba(255,255,255,0.08), 0 0 0 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.6), 0 0 0 10px #1a1a1e, 0 0 0 11px rgba(255,255,255,0.06), 0 0 60px rgba(0,0,0,0.5)`
- A black pill-shaped Dynamic Island at the top center: 120px wide, 32px tall, fully rounded, z-index 50
