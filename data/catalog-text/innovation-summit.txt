Create a mobile app showcase page that displays 3 phone-screen mockups side by side for an event called "Unfold" by MEWS. The page background is a muted purple (`#433B73`). Each screen is displayed inside a phone frame (393x873px with rounded corners). The screens should have entrance animations on page load.

- Video covers the entire frame, with a dark overlay on top (`rgba(0,0,0,.12)`), a bottom gradient fade (transparent to near-black over the bottom 34%), and a top gradient fade (semi-black fading to transparent over the top 16%)

### Animations

All CSS-only, triggered on page load with staggered delays:

1. **Rise in** (translateY 26px to 0, fade in) - for headers, descriptions, CTA
2. **Blur in** (translateY + scale + blur + letter-spacing animate to normal) - for the "Unfold" title
3. **Clip up** (clip-path reveal from bottom) - for section titles
4. **Line grow** (scaleX 0 to 1 from left) - for dividers
5. **Stagger children** (each child delays by +70ms) - for chips and grid cards
6. **Sheen** (white gradient sweeps across CTA button once after 1.5s)

Use `cubic-bezier(.16, 1, .3, 1)` (expo out) for most animations. Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

Stagger timing: Home elements start at 0.45s-0.95s. Speakers elements at 0.6s-1.3s. FAQs elements at 0.8s-1.25s.

### Responsive

- 3 screens side by side on desktop (flexbox, gap 40px)
- Wrap on screens below 900px
- Scale down phone frames on very small screens (below 440px)

---

### Key Design Details

- Phone frames should look like real device bezels (large border-radius 44px, dark background, overflow hidden)
- The home screen frame has no visible border; the other two have a subtle light purple/gray border
- Speaker card images have a dark fallback background (`#1a1a1e`) while loading
- The FAQ content uses a scale trick (93% transform) to fit more content while looking natural
- No JavaScript interactions needed - this is a static visual showcase with CSS entrance animations only
