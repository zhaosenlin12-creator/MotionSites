**Hover Interactions (on all video containers):**
- Videos scale to 1.08 on hover with cubic-bezier(0.33, 1, 0.68, 1) over 0.5s
- A dark overlay (rgba(0,0,0,0.25)) fades in over 0.4s on hover

- Pill shape (20px border-radius), white text, 11px font, weight 600, 4px 12px padding, capitalized, background color matches each post's assigned color

**Fonts:**
- Google Fonts: Inter (400, 500, 600) for body text, Outfit (500, 600, 700) for headings and titles

**Responsive:**
- At 1024px: featured post becomes single column, grid becomes 2 columns, featured content padding 40px
- At 768px: heading drops to 48px, header-bottom stacks vertically, grid becomes 1 column, featured title drops to 32px

**Data Source:**
- Store all blog post data (type, badge, title, description, author, category, category_color, image/video URL, display_order) in a Supabase `blog_posts` table
- Fetch and render dynamically, ordered by display_order ascending
- Enable RLS with public read access for anon and authenticated users

**Tech Stack:**
- React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS (for base resets only, use custom CSS for the blog styles)
- Supabase JS client for data fetching
- All videos use autoPlay, loop, muted, playsInline attributes
