Build a production-ready, responsive landing page using React, Tailwind CSS v4, and Vite. The design should feature a high-end, dark-mode "glassmorphism" aesthetic with specific purple/pink gradients.

1. Tech Stack & Libraries:
Use hls.js for video streaming.
Use motion/react (formerly Framer Motion) for animations.
Use react-use-measure for sizing logic.
Use clsx and tailwind-merge for class management.
Use lucide-react for standard icons (if needed), but I will provide custom SVG paths for specific UI elements.

2. Global Styling:
Background: Dark/Black (#010101).
Primary Gradient: A diagonal gradient used for accents: from-[#FA93FA] via-[#C967E8] to-[#983AD6].
Typography: Modern sans-serif, center-aligned hero text.

3. Hero Section Components:
Announcement Pill:
A pill-shaped top badge.
Background: Semi-transparent dark (bg-[rgba(28,27,36,0.15)]) with a subtle border.
Icon: A "Zap" icon inside a gradient-filled box with a glow effect.
Text: "Used by founders. Loved by devs." in light grey.

Main Headline (H1):
Large text (responsive sizing: 48px mobile to 80px desktop).
Text: "Your Vision" on line 1, "Our Digital Reality." on line 2.
Style: Text should have a gradient fill (White to Purple/Pink).

Subheadline:
Text: "We turn bold ideas into modern designs that don't just look amazing, they grow your business fast."
Color: text-white/80.

CTA Button:
"Book a 15-min call" text.
Rounded full button with a white background and black text.
Includes a circle icon with an arrow inside, styled with the primary purple gradient.
Outer border wrapper with a glass effect.

4. Hero Video Integration (Critical Details):
Source: HLS Stream URL: https://customer-cbeadsgr09pnsezs.cloudflarestream.com/697945ca6b876878dba3b23fbd2f1561/manifest/video.m3u8
Fallback: If HLS fails, fallback to this MP4: /_videos/v1/f0c78f536d5f21a047fb7792723a36f9d647daa1
Implementation: Do NOT use react-player. Use a native <video> tag with a custom useEffect hook implementation of hls.js.
Styling:
Blend Mode: Use mix-blend-screen so the video black background blends into the page.
Positioning: The video should be at the bottom of the hero. Apply a negative top margin (-mt-[150px]) so it overlaps behind the text.
Z-Index: Ensure the text content is z-20 (above) and video is z-10 (below).
Layout: The video must be 100% width (w-full), auto height, and stretch edge-to-edge without being cropped (do not use object-contain or fixed heights).
Overlay: Add a gradient fade (from-[#010101] via-transparent to-[#010101]) over the video container.

5. Logo Cloud Section (Animated):
Place this section immediately below the video.
Background: Semi-transparent glass (bg-black/20 backdrop-blur-sm) with a top border (border-white/5).
Layout:
Desktop: "Powering the best teams" text on the left, separated by a vertical divider. Animated logo slider on the right.
Mobile: Stacked vertically.
Animation: Create an InfiniteSlider component using motion/react that scrolls logos horizontally forever.
Logos: Use these SVG URLs (OpenAI, Nvidia, GitHub, etc.) and apply brightness-0 invert to make them white.

Please assemble these into a cohesive Hero.tsx, App.tsx, and components/ui/infinite-slider.tsx structure.
