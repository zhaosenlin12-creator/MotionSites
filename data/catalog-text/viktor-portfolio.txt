Build a high-end, cinematic 2-page architectural portfolio using React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion (motion/react). The aesthetic is minimalist, dark-themed (black background, white text), and uses a sophisticated typographic hierarchy.

Global Configuration:

Fonts: Import and use 'Orbitron' for display headings, 'Space Grotesk' for body text, and 'JetBrains Mono' for technical/mono elements.

Selection: Custom selection color (white background, black text).

Icons: Use lucide-react (Snowflake, Maximize, Zap, ArrowLeft, ArrowRight).

Page 1: Hero (Modern Architect)

Background: Full-screen looping video: https://d8j0ntlcm91z4.cloudfront.net/user_38xzZboKViGWJOttwIXH07lWA1P/hf_20260304_101127_49ce07b7-f19a-4882-b19c-1d2a27d97ac3.mp4.

Settings: Muted, playsInline, loop, preload="auto".

Overlays: Radial vignette on desktop (70% transparent center to 70% black edges) and a bottom-fade gradient on mobile.

Top Nav: Right-aligned '1/01' counter with a progress line and a 'Next Project' button in mono font.

Main Content:

Large title: 'Viktor-O // MODERN ARCHITECT' (font-display, uppercase, tracking-tighter).

Description: Light-weight sans text with a max-width of 450px.

Technical Specs (Right Column): A list (Stack, Logic, Uptime, Scale) with labels and values separated by thin border-white/20.

Bottom Section:

A glass-morphism card (bg-white/5, backdrop-blur-xl) with a tech image (https://picsum.photos/seed/tech/200/200), project title 'VK-01: React Engine', and a 'View Project' button.

A row of pill-shaped tags (TS/JS, V1, Full-Stack, Cloud-Ready) at the bottom right.

Massive display title on the left: 'PROJECTY ENGINE' (leading-0.85, uppercase).

Right-aligned description text about a flagship React engine, with a 'Read More' link featuring a minimalist underline.

Bottom Section:

Two structured info blocks: '01 // CORE ARCHITECTURE' and '02 // PERFORMANCE METRICS' with uppercase mono subtext.

Navigation arrows (Left/Right) in circular borders and a meta-info block (Date | Project) with an italicized caption.

Interactions & Responsiveness:

Use AnimatePresence for smooth opacity/exit transitions between pages.

Implement entrance animations for text and cards (opacity and y-offset).

On mobile: The video should occupy the top half (h-[50vh]) with a smooth gradient transition to the content below.
